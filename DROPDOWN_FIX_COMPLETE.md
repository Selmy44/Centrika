# ✅ Dropdown Hover Fix - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Issue Fixed
The dropdown menus were not showing on hover because the parent nav links had real `href` attributes that caused navigation before hover could trigger.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **index.html Navigation Update**
- Changed all dropdown parent links from real URLs to `javascript:void(0)`
- Updated all dropdown links to point to the correct pages in `pages/` folder
- Added both `has-dropdown` and `dropdown` classes for compatibility
- Added Font Awesome 6 icons to all dropdown items

**Before:**
```html
<li class="has-dropdown">
  <a href="solutions.html">Solutions <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a>
```

**After:**
```html
<li class="has-dropdown dropdown">
  <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="dropdown-toggle">Solutions <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a>
```

### 2. **navbar-custom.css Improvements**
- Added `pointer-events: none` to hidden dropdowns
- Added `pointer-events: auto` to visible dropdowns on hover
- Improved z-index to 9999 for better layering
- Enhanced dark mode support with backdrop blur
- Better border colors for dark mode visibility
- Reduced margin-top for quicker dropdown appearance (10px vs 15px)
- Increased min-width to 260px for better readability

### 3. **Font Awesome Update**
- Upgraded from Font Awesome 5.8.1 to 6.4.0
- This supports the modern `fas` icon classes used in dropdowns

### 4. **Dark Mode CSS Added**
- Linked `dark-mode.css` to index.html
- Added dark mode dropdown shadows with `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`

## ✨ Hover Behavior

1. **Hover on parent nav item** → Dropdown slides down smoothly
2. **Arrow icon rotates** 180° to indicate open state
3. **Dropdown items** have left accent bar on hover
4. **Smooth transitions** on all states
5. **Icons displayed** with each menu item
6. **Pointer events** properly managed for click access

## 🚀 How to Test

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Hover over "Solutions", "Services", "Products", or "Company"
3. Dropdown should appear smoothly within 0.3s
4. Move mouse into dropdown - it should stay open
5. Click any item to navigate to that page
6. Toggle dark mode to test dropdown visibility in both themes

## 📝 Technical Details

**CSS Transitions:**
- Duration: 0.3s
- Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
- Properties: opacity, visibility, transform

**Z-Index Layers:**
- Header: Default layer
- Dropdown: 9999 (ensures visibility above all content)

**Pointer Events:**
